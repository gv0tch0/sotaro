## Spring cOntent negoTiation And maRshalling tOy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gv0tch0/sotaro.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gv0tch0/sotaro)


### What is it? What is it?

Showcases a project that:
- Uses solely Spring (currently v4.0.5) for content negotiation and marshaling.
- Uses JAXB to generate the object representation of the responses.
- Supports both XML and JSON content negotiation.
- Honors the JAXB annotations when marshaling JSON responses.
- Avoids leaking the `JAXBElement`-wrapper around the response object.

### Motivation

I was having a hard time trying to get XML negotiation and marshalling over HTTP working for a service that uses [Spring Web MVC](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html). This project contains a toy example that exemplified the problem and supported an ask on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24040084) hoping that someone can solve the problem for me.

It used to be the case that when this toy example was built and run (see below for HOWTO) the "service" responded with a 406 Not Acceptable to requests that asked for XML content back.

Here is a example of a problematic request/response cycle (some of the output has been omitted for brevity).
```
  [...]$ curl -v -X GET -H "Accept: application/xml" http://localhost:8080/sotaro/say/boo | tidy -ashtml -utf8 --indent yes
  * Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080 (#0)
  > GET /sotaro/say/boo HTTP/1.1
  > User-Agent: curl/7.30.0
  > Host: localhost:8080
  > Accept: application/xml
  >
  < HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
  * Server Apache-Coyote/1.1 is not blacklisted
  < Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
  < Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  < Content-Language: en
  < Content-Length: 1067
  < Date: Wed, 04 Jun 2014 12:48:44 GMT
  <
  <html>
    <body>
      <h1>HTTP Status 406 -</h1>
      <p><b>message</b></p>
      <p><b>description</b> <u>The resource identified by this request is only capable of generating responses with characteristics not acceptable according to the request "accept" headers.</u></p>
    </body>
  </html>
```

Since then I have been able to solve the issue by retrning response objects wrapped in `JAXBElement`s and configuring the JAXB marshaller to accept and marshal `JAXBElement`s.

The project continues to support more involved content scenarios. E.g. adding support for JSON, etc.

### Solution Constraints

- Spring configuration should stay in XML.
- The response object which is marshalled back should stay generated by JAXB2 based on [this schema](https://github.com/gv0tch0/sotaro/blob/master/src/main/resources/sotaro.xsd). As such the object is missing the @XmlRootElement annotation, but JAXB2 generates an `ObjectFactory` which has the means to wrap it in a `JAXBElement` which makes XML marshallers [happy](https://github.com/gv0tch0/sotaro/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/gv0tch0/sotaro/MarshalSayWhatTest.java).
- Success configuration should allow for other content types to be added later on, e.g. `JSON`.

### Building

The implementation is in java. To build please use [maven](http://maven.apache.org/ "Maven Home"). Pull the repository and type `mvn` at the top-level repository directory.

#### Build Dependencies

- Internet connection. This is necessary to pull the project's dependencies expressed in the project's pom (and any transitive dependencies that those pull). The central maven repository contains all of them.
- Maven 2.2.1+.
- JDK 1.6+.

### Running

Running the project has been tested in [Tomcat 7](http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi) (more specifically 7.0.54). After the project has been successfully built, copy the `${project.basedir}/target/sotaro.war` file under the `${tomcat.basedir}/webapps` directory, fire up tomcat, and `curl -v -X GET -H "Accept: application/xml" http://localhost:8080/sotaro/say/boo` away (assuming tomcat is running locally and is listening on its default port, `8080`).
